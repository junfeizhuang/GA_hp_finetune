# GA_hp_finetune

This is an easy example to use genetic algorithm finding the deep network architecture for a batter classification accuracy.

It also fit for searching hyper parameters.

## Prepare

[gaft](https://github.com/PytLab/gaft)

```Script
pip install gaft
```

[mpi4py](https://pypi.org/project/mpi4py/1.1.0/)

```Script
pip install mpi4py
```

## Network search

We fix the convolution layers to find the reasonable channel number for two fully connected layers.

fc1 search from 100 neurons to 120 neurons.

fc2 search from 60 neurons to 80 neurons.

The GA algorithm recommanded results is 110 for fc1 and 63 for fc2.

You can set the number of GPU to run with MPI.

## Run
```Script
mpiexec -n 1 python3 run.py -gpu 3
```
## Dataset

[Cifar10](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

## Log

The log name is `best_fit.py` show as below
